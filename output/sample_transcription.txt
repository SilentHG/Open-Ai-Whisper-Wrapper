[00:00 - 00:08]  best of it and then they have been coming with a lot of change requests after that,
[00:08 - 00:14]  even fourth and back. So suddenly they didn't want to have things that were confirmed pick up
[00:14 - 00:18]  in store and then they suddenly wanted to have things that were confirmed to pick up. So
[00:20 - 00:27]  a lot of changes going on there. And I think the reason where we have this meeting is the transition
[00:27 - 00:34]  of the closed down of the universal analytics, which the whole Apple report think solution is built
[00:34 - 00:42]  upon now. That will not longer work as of two months from now as the consensus and
[00:42 - 00:49]  we're looking at the most agile and best way of setting up these reports as it is.
[00:49 - 00:58]  As you know, of course these can be built directly into BigQuery as we do today, but of course
[00:58 - 01:08]  the way that the data model and information in GA4 is a little bit more extensive than the old one,
[01:08 - 01:16]  which makes the reports will be kind of quite quite a struggle to build a directory. That's why
[01:16 - 01:22]  the solution here since funnel is already been kind of acquired and purchased for at least one
[01:22 - 01:30]  more year, wasn't so Simon. That's something for you. Yeah, then it's easier to actually take out
[01:30 - 01:36]  the reports in the same format that Apple wants directly in from the connectivity funnel connector
[01:36 - 01:42]  and then dump it into a BigQuery. So that it would kind of work the same way for them,
[01:42 - 01:53]  but it's just easier to maintain on both. Yeah, but I think we need to figure out if funnel can
[01:53 - 01:59]  actually be used for it and so in all these new demands and wishes that Apple has,
[01:59 - 02:07]  he said actually something that we can push from funnel. So I'm not fully aware of the new requirements
[02:08 - 02:14]  they have. But for example, on an event parameter level, we can't push that from funnel for
[02:14 - 02:22]  time. So we need to do that in BigQuery anyway. So Maria correct me if I'm wrong and also for the
[02:22 - 02:28]  different delivery method. If that's not in a specific event for example, then we can use funnel
[02:28 - 02:35]  for that specific task. So I think we need to get to get the full overview of what we actually
[02:35 - 02:41]  can use funnel for in this case. I think you call maybe the best to assist that. Yeah, and
[02:42 - 02:47]  but there's just one question that I also have to raise for this implicitly of this and that is
[02:48 - 02:56]  have your checked as the if if Ultricks has come with a GA4 connector that could be used in this case.
[02:57 - 03:06]  No, not really. We're looking into decommissioning Ultricks for data integration. So it wouldn't
[03:06 - 03:15]  really be relevant either way. But I lost the connection a bit earlier when you talked about funnel.
[03:15 - 03:22]  But so from my understanding funnel is kind of a integration tool between Google products and an
[03:22 - 03:27]  external data warehousing solution. So if that the correct understanding or what exactly is the purpose
[03:27 - 03:34]  of funnel. Well, for 222 to kind of give it very simple funnel. It's basically just a funnel.
[03:34 - 03:42]  It's basically a very simple plug and play EDP connector between various sources that is aimed for
[03:43 - 03:48]  that is very neat for using digital marketing channels. For example, and Google Analytics data
[03:48 - 03:53]  for transferring the data. And as you know more than anyone is still building all of these
[03:53 - 03:58]  connectors into all of the different sources yourself is a hassle and also maintaining it.
[03:58 - 04:04]  So there you have kind of that funnel. And it's kind of pre both with out outsource for if it's
[04:04 - 04:10]  power BI or if it's like BigQuery or whatever. So it's just a very simple way of transferring kind of
[04:10 - 04:15]  the data from different sources. Because one thing we have to consider here is to
[04:18 - 04:30]  also instantly the HQ and let's go. We lost you see and write us yourself what we need to
[04:30 - 04:40]  consider is and then we lost you. Just which story did my phone network maybe that is better.
[04:40 - 04:48]  Yeah, well, we need to consider is where for the new data warehouse that we need all the data
[04:48 - 04:53]  as raw as possible and very well into the data warehouse because we're separating it into three
[04:53 - 05:00]  layers now. So I don't know how all of that is that only providing like.
[05:00 - 05:10]  Thank you.
[05:11 - 05:14]  Amen.
[05:14 - 05:16]  Yes, I'm serious. And the most important part.
[05:16 - 05:25]  Okay. So my question is hard. Just make it very simple. Is funnel able to provide the raw
[05:25 - 05:29]  underlying data or is it just providing like a polished ready to use a gold dimples?
[05:33 - 05:40]  The last one. Okay. Yeah, so it's it's it's on a more aggregate level.
[05:41 - 05:46]  Then we can get for example from the native integration between BigQuery and the NGFO.
[05:47 - 05:53]  So it is more like a problem play data model that we can that we for example could use on
[05:54 - 05:57]  and some of the other use cases that we have discussed for example,
[05:57 - 06:02]  pay to use on an hour level for example. We can use funnel for that, but down to an
[06:03 - 06:10]  event parameters and raw session or use a pseudo ID level raw data we can use funnel for that.
[06:10 - 06:17]  So we would need to do the native integration for that part. Okay. So basically data transfer for
[06:17 - 06:22]  raw data and then follow for the pre made models for the data.
[06:23 - 06:30]  Yeah, but there's no way for us to modify the code that will kind of be just a product delivered
[06:30 - 06:41]  by funnel. So we cannot customize the output in a way or no, it's a you can you can customize the output
[06:41 - 06:48]  and it moves in funnel. But okay. So do do kind of the transformation of the data
[06:48 - 06:54]  without but there you can do but not not that any can code. So it's not like a code
[06:54 - 06:59]  takes really provide like to finish data form scripts is basically just a data dump into
[06:59 - 07:09]  the data. Yeah, yes, okay. Yeah. But this is and this is this is now been talking about
[07:09 - 07:17]  for the attributes. Like the all of the raw data from GA4 is still available in BigQuery,
[07:17 - 07:22]  but this is just for the attributes that we're talking about using this. Okay.
[07:22 - 07:32]  But yeah, that's exciting. How can we get started doing this? Is it like a granted data
[07:32 - 07:40]  a service key and it just plug and play click run and everything starts working or is it a bit more
[07:40 - 07:47]  complex than that? Yes, buddy, you have been looking into Twitter already right? So they have
[07:48 - 07:55]  Yeah, exactly. So I tried to replicate one of the reports using the native GA4 data from BigQuery
[07:57 - 08:04]  and I quickly found out that as Core said, the data model is quite extensive in comparison to
[08:04 - 08:12]  the universal analytics one. For instance, when we count session IDs in GA4, it's quite different
[08:13 - 08:20]  from the way we do it in universal analytics. And as I see with the Apple reports,
[08:20 - 08:26]  is that we utilize the like the raw form of data to count session.
